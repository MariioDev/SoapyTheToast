Hey There 👋🏽. I'm a 15 year old full stack developer, self-teaching myself while I'm still in highschool. I love to code in my free time, and love technology in general. I also am an aspiring businessman. Oh, and yes, I also hate css, use a lot of Javacript and want to become an Arch user (I see you senior software engineers laughing at me while you use your Arch Linux PC wanting to flex about your salary and position that you **had** FAANG company, but I'll be there some day). </br>
